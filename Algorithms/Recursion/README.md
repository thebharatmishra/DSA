# Recursion

### What is recursion?

Function calls itself.

```
int random(int num){
    ....
    ....
    ....
    random(num)
}
```

It is used when a Bigger problem depends upon similar type of smaller problem.

### Example:

$2^n$ : 2 to the power n.

$2^4$ = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 \
$2^4$ = 2 x $2^3$ \
$2^n$ = 2 x $2^{n-1}$ \
f(n) = 2 x f(n-1)

Another example could be [**Factorial**](../Recursion/Factorial.cpp).

5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 \
5! = 5 x 4! \
n! = n x (n-1)! \
f(n) = n x f(n-1) \

NOTE : Where the program stops in recursion it is called a base case.
like factorial at 0! = 1.

**Recursion**

- Base case - Returning the function is mandatory.
- Recursive relation.

When there is base case we know when to stop. When there is no base case, Segmentation fault occurs.

Stack Overflow happens as the program does not stops.So base case is mandatory.
