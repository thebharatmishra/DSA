# Greedy Algorithms

Not the best optimized approach. But the good enough approach for that particular time.

Local Optimum Approach.

We need to make $18 out of $5, $2, $1 coins. Using minimum coins.

We can do {5+5+5+2+1}

Questions related to Greedy approach consists of sorting, max, min, priority queue, set, custom comparator.
